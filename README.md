# iolite4 python repository
Community resources and examples of python-based plugins for iolite4.

**Note**
Some of these examples are a work in progress and as such they are not necessarily meant to be used as is, but are meant to demonstrate parts of the API and provide a jumping off point for your own creations.
If you have any questions about any of the resources here, please contact iolite on the iolite support email address (see https://iolite.xyz for details).
